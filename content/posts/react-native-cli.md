## create reactnative app
If you previously installed a global react-native-cli package, please remove it as it may cause unexpected issues:

``` sh
npm uninstall -g react-native-cli @react-native-community/cli
```

You can use React Native Community CLI to generate a new project. Let's create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

``` sh
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init AwesomeProject
```
